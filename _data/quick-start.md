description: Getting started with LangStream
---
Getting started on Mac with LangStream is easy. You only need to have [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) installed.

### 1. Install LangStream using Homebrew

```bash
brew tap LangStream/langstream
brew install langstream
```

### 2. Set OpenAI key in an environment variable

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

### 3. Start LangStream application using Docker

```bash
langstream docker run test \
  -app https://github.com/LangStream/langstream/blob/main/examples/applications/openai-completions \
  -s https://github.com/LangStream/langstream/blob/main/examples/secrets/secrets.yaml
```

This will download the `openai-completions` example from the LangStream repository and run it using the default secrets file, which expects the secrets to be in environment variables. The application provides a complete backend for a chatbot that uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo to generate responses. It includes a WebSocket gateway for easy access to the streaming AI agents from application environments including web browsers.

### 4. Connect to the WebSocket gateway using the built-in chat client

In a different terminal window:

```bash
langstream gateway chat test -cg consume-output -pg produce-input -p sessionId=$(uuidgen)
```

### 5. Chat with the bot

```bash

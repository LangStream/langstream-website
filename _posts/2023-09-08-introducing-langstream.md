Unless you’ve been living under a technology rock, you know that Generative AI (Gen AI) is the hottest technology to come around in a while. So-called pundits are comparing it to the introduction of the iPhone, which ushered in the mobile wave, or even the 
World Wide Web (gasp!).

I don’t know what the ultimate impact of Gen AI will be, but I do know it feels like we are currently in a race. A race to figure out how to build Gen AI applications that can take advantage of the groundbreaking power of this technology that we’ve all intuitively understood since we typed that prompt into ChatGPT and got back that mind-blowing response. 

Since that moment, I have wanted a quick and easy way to turn my Gen AI ideas into a prototype. And once I have a prototype that looks good, a clear path to turning that into a production application. And knowing the power of streaming and event-driven architectures, I wanted those applications to be event-driven. In other words, I want an easy way to combine the power of streaming with the power of the Large Language Model in a way that is flexible enough to evolve as we learn more about what we can actually accomplish with Gen AI. 

And on top of that, I want someone else to take care of the hard parts, so I can just focus on building out my great Gen AI idea.

Given that, you’ll understand why I am super excited to introduce LangStream.
